## Abstract

In the realm of agriculture and farming, effective pest and parasite management is paramount. Identifying and understanding the behavior of problem pests is crucial for implementing targeted control measures. This project delves into the identification, prediction, and classification of subspecies of collected insects, with a specific focus on water striders, using the k-means clustering method.

By leveraging the k-means clustering algorithm, the project partitions collected insect samples into distinct species clusters. Further analysis, utilizing logistic regression, is then conducted on the predicted species clusters to classify insects within each species as either male or female. This analysis provides insights into mating preference variations among different species of water striders or similar insects, whether they are pests, parasites, or otherwise.

The project achieves these objectives by utilizing insect dimensions, such as average leg length and body size, as key features for classification and analysis.

## Methodology

### K-Means Clustering
- Identifies and partitions collected insect samples into distinct species clusters.

### Logistic Regression
- Classifies insects within each species cluster as male or female.
- Analyzes mating preference variations among different species.

## Data Attributes

- **Leg Length**: Average length of insect legs.
- **Body Size**: Average size of insect bodies.

## Result

The project's comprehensive analysis sheds light on the behavioral patterns and mating preferences of water striders and similar insects. By utilizing dimensions such as leg length and body size, the project provides valuable insights for effective pest and parasite management in agriculture and farming.

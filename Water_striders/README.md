This project focuses on identifying,predicting & successfully partitioning available subspecies of collected water strider insects using the k-means clustering method. 
By zooming in on respective, predicted species (clusters), it does a further analysis (logistic regression) on the sample data and classifies water striders within a certain species 
as either male or female, in the process showing mating preference variation between said species of water striders.
All of this it accomplishes using average leg length and body size of said water-striders.
